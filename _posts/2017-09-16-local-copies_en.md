You can get a backup of the Referendum website from a [Github repository, GrenderG/referendum_cat_mirror](https://github.com/GrenderG/referendum_cat_mirror) by cloning it or by downloading a [ZIP file](https://github.com/GrenderG/referendum_cat_mirror/archive/master.zip)).

You can also get the most up to date information in the [official Twitter account of the referendum](https://twitter.com/ref1oct).

The official URLs have been censored but there is large [list of replicas of the Referendum website](https://github.com/GrenderG/referendum_cat_mirror#lista-de-mirrors). Be cautious! They can be managed by third parties.
