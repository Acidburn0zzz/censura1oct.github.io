> 'I find that offensive.' It has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. 'I am offended by that.' Well, so fucking what.

# Overview
This website wants to document the technical tools used by the Spanish government to censor official informative websites about the referendum in Catalonia to be held on October 1, 2017.
This attempt of blocking free access to information has not been successful: the censored contents have been replicated in [many  places](/en/2017/09/16/local-copies.html) and can even be  [downloaded](https://github.com/GrenderG/referendum_cat_mirror/archive/master.zip)

Documenting the methods is a good way of helping future attempts to fail.

- [What can I do under this censorship?](/en/2017/09/16/what-can-you-do_en.html)
