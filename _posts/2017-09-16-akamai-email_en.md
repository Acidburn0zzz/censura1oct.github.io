Akamai is a content delivery network services provider used by Guardia Civil (Spanish half civilian half militarized police) to display a message in the websites they seize instead of their genuine content.

Probably Akamai is not aware of this service abuse.

Tell them on Twitter [click here](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Hi%20%40Akamai%2C%20do%20you%20know%20that%20%40guardiacivil%20is%20using%20your%20services%20to%20block%20legitimate%20websites%3F).

Or tell them by e-mail. Instructions [here](/en/2017/09/16/akamai_en.html).
