Write to **abuse@akamai.com** and ask this provider that they prevent Guardia Civil from using their services because they are not compliant with their terms and conditions.

> There seems to be a malicious use of Akamai services: users in Spain trying to access the domain ref1oct.eu from several networks (Vodafone, Movistar, Euskaltel) are getting third party injected content instead of the legitimate one, and the injected content is being served by Akamai. At least the IP 92.122.241.196 seems involved in what seems like an attack, there may be more.
